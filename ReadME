1.) Assignment 1, CS 260 " BAG OF MARBLES "

2.) A program that can model a bag of marbles would be creating classes that represents a marble.
Each class will have a color variable (int red, int blue, int green). Color can be used to represent
marbles. By setting color as int, it will allow us to add and subtract marbles from the color the user picks. 

The way we can connect all the classes together can be by using if statements. We will need to use strings
to allow the user to pick whatever color they want to add marbles or subtract marbles from. 

Since we want to keep asking the user if they want to add or subtract marbles, using a do loop can be extremely 
helpful. After the user has added or subtracted marbles, we can leave them the option of keep using the program
or exit. 

There are plenty of test that could be done such as when the program starts, there should be zero marbles in 
the bags. After picking a color, we can test if the code is properly adding the marbles to the proper bag.
We can also test if the marbles are being subtracted properly.
